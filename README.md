# Conflicting Goals in Architecture: A study on Multi-Objective Optimization 

This repository aims to provide the code and the results obtained during the optimization processes. These results refer to the paper published on the 24th CAADRIA conference on 2019 and which is available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332834114_Conflicting_Goals_In_Architecture_A_study_on_Multi-Objective_Optimisation).

These results were obtained using [ADOPT](https://github.com/PastelBelem8/ADOPT.jl), the [ADA](https://algorithmicdesign.github.io/) OPTimization framework I developed in the course of my master dissertation, and the [Khepri](https://github.com/aptmcl/Khepri.jl) tool.


## Abstract

Sustainability and economic factors are driving architectural practice towards more efficient designs. The application of optimization to the design process becomes essential to reduce the environmental footprint of buildings, as well as to reduce their costs. Building design requirements tend to be conflicting, involving the optimization of multiple goals simultaneously, which often translates to different compromises among the goals. Ideally, to make more informed and intelligent decisions, the architect should be given a set of design variations representing a heterogeneous sample of the optimal compromises one can achieve. In this paper, we discuss different approaches to find such compromises and we focus on multi-objective optimization algorithms that produce the required design variants, applying them in the context of an architectural case study.
